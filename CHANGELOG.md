# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. Format is a
loose variant of [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
with 4-digit `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.MICRO` version numbers.

## [0.1.1.0] - 2026-10-02

### Added

- **Design doc for the SLAM ladder** (`docs/design/2026-10-02-slamlab-ladder.md`). It covers the
  rungs from first-principles geometry to MegaSaM-style dense SLAM, including visual-inertial;
  each language's role; nine milestones, two of them reifyscene payoffs; the one-way boundary
  with reifyscene; edge results from budget-matched simulation; datasets and metrics; and
  renaming before the repository goes public.

- **Three-language scaffold.** One placeholder function, `hat` (the skew-symmetric matrix of a
  3-vector), is implemented in Python (`slamlab.so3`), C++ (`slamlab_core`, bound with nanobind
  as `slamlab._cpp`) and Rust (`slamlab-core`, bound with PyO3 as `slamlab_rs`).
  `slamlab.backends` picks an implementation at runtime. A parity test checks every built backend
  against shared fixtures in `tests/fixtures/`. The C++ and Rust cores also build and test
  standalone, without Python.

- **Conda environment, matching reifyscene.** `scripts/setup_slamlab.sh` builds the env with
  Python 3.11, cmake, ninja, a C++ compiler and Rust, all from conda-forge, then installs the pip
  layer from `scripts/locks/slamlab.lock` (`scripts/gen_env_lock.sh`). Each env gets its own C++
  build folder, `build/<env>`; two Python 3.11 envs sharing one CMake tree silently reused each
  other's cached compiler.

- **CI** (`.github/workflows/test.yml`): runs the Python suite with both extensions built, the
  standalone C++ tests (ctest), and Rust fmt, clippy and tests.

## [0.1.0.0] - 2026-10-02

### Added

- **Repository bootstrap.** `main`/`develop` branches, the `VERSION` file as the single
  version source, this changelog, the PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0 license, and the two tag workflows
  (`v<version>` on develop version bumps, `release-v<version>` plus a GitHub Release on
  develop -> main merges).
